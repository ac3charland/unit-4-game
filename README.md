# Unit 4 Game
The following is a small RPG game based around Nintendo's "Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild," one of my favorite games of all time. It's built using the Bootstrap and jQuery frameworks and allows the user to play as one of four characters. You can try out the deployed version at *https://ac3charland.github.io/unit-4-game/*.

The HTML skeleton of the page is found in *index.html*. The logic of the game, as well as the creation and deletion of many of the game's assets, is done in *logic.js*.

The game's assets are organized into one CSS stylesheet (*assets/css/style.css*) several images (*assets/images/*) and a few sound files to play at various points in the game (*assets/sounds/*).
